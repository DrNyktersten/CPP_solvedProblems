Problem
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:

d = 1/2gt^2

The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.

Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument.
The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. 
Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes
the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.

        t = i + 1; 
        d = fallingDistance(t); 
        cout << t << " seconds = "
